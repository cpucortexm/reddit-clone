# Project Requirements

- creating the model for holding the application data
- we’ll create a bunch of fake communities, fake users, and inside them fake content
- we’ll show the content in the homepage
- letting people signup/login to the website and pick a username
- after login, the user will be able to interact with content by upvoting or downvoting posts
- a user can add posts to a subreddit
- a user can add images to a post
- a user can add comments to posts
- comments can be nested (you can comment another comment)
- a user has a profile
- isolated communities (subreddits)
- nested comments (we had comments in the Twitter clone, but you could not reply to replies to a Tweet, so no nested comments)
- a upvote/downvote mechanism
- uploading images to AWS S3
